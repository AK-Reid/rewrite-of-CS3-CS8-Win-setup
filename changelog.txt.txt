Removed instructions for opening cmd - Clutter, anyone can figure this out.
Removed all inital checks for installed software - Clutter, it's very unlikely a student will come into the class and have git, cmake, or mingw installed and not know. 
Added pretty icons for each step. 

Installing git section: 
Changed link to a more user friendly download page with a very obvious download button that won't let you accidentally download the 32bit git or git for a different OS. 
Made the screenshot layout more compact, removed an unnecessary screenshot. 
Added a new section for how to setup and configure personal access tokens. 

Installing cmake section:
Added annotation to make the installer version more clear
Made image layout more compact

Installing MinGW section:
Reduced the number of steps from 10 to 2, the installation process is now extremely easy and simple.
Significantly simplified setting the path, removing unncessary steps i.e setting the g++.exe in the environment and simply setting the entire bin folder.
